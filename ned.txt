 ned.c        A simple four-function text editor
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ned is a simple text editor for those who can't be bothered with the
 finickiness of vi and don't like waiting for emacs to drag its dripping
 elephantine carcass into core just for the sake of making a quick edit
 to a file.

 ned was originally written for MS-DOS because I needed a simple editor
 that would work from a session CTTY'd down a COM port.  It can still
 fulfill that role.

 Current version tested by me under NetBSD 1.*, Linux, MS-DOS (Turbo C V2.0).
 Also seen working under Solaris 2.6 and HPUX 10.20.  Older version tested
 with Digital Unix; should work with most Unices.

 Compiling under Unix:
      cc -o ned ned.c -lcurses -ltermcap
      or just sh ned.c

 Compiling under DOS (Turbo C v2.0; later versions should be similar --
 switches are just to turn off some overly paranoid warnings, to use
 the large memory model, and enable emulation of curses functions)
      tcc -DDOS -ml -w-pia -w-par ned

 Note: Under DOS requires ANSI.SYS or equivalent.
